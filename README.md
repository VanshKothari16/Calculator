1. #Structure: This class is used to make a simple Frame which shows all four types of Calculator in the Form of Button.In this class, I had used two major classes to design the Frame. One is **JFrame** to design the Frame with its different methods like **setBounds(),setDefaultCloseOperation(),setLayout(),add()**,etc. Other is **JButton** class to show four button on the Frame with its different method like **setTitle(),setBounds(),addActionListener()**,etc. Most important feature of this class is that I made use of **ActionListener** interface to add some action when user press the button with its overrided method **"public void addActionPerformed(ActionEvent e)"**; I have extended **Connection** java class in this class so that when user press any of the four button it's respective class will run.
